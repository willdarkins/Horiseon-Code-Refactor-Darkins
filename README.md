## Project Description
***
The client, Horiseon, is a digital marketing company asking us to refactor their website's HTML & CSS to better meet accesibility standards, which will result in a more optimized website for search engines. Other major priorities include clear and semantic HTML elements, and the addition of optimized alt image attributes. 

## Summation of Adjustments
***
The following adjustments were made to portions of code that worked to meet the client's standards:
1. **Title Change**
* The site's new title "Horiseon - Marketing Solutions" communicates the company's purpose in a concise manner.
2. **Semantic HTML elements & corresponding classes/ID's**
* A logical structure of elements was created for better read-ability
* Secitons, classes and ID's have been re-calssified to better reflect the elements' purpose
* Nav bar has been created in place of the use of <div> 
* Comments have been added to indicate the begining of content blocks
3. **Alt attributes added to images**
* Attributes utilize market specific key words to create the opportunity for better placement on SERPs
4. **Links now correspond correctly**
5. **CSS selectors fall in sequential order of importance**
* Properties have been aggregated under more concise selector groups to condense longer code
